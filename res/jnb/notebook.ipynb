Generally, Data analyst, engineer, and scientists are handling relational or tabular data. These tabular data columns have either numerical or categorical data.  Generated data has a variety of structures such as text, image, audio, and video. Online activities such as articles, website text, blog posts, social media posts are generating unstructured textual data.  Corporate and business need to analyze textual data to understand customer activities, opinion, and feedback to successfully derive their business. To compete with big textual data, text analytics is evolving at a faster rate than ever before.\n\nText Analytics has lots of applications in today's online world. By analyzing tweets on Twitter, we can find trending news and peoples reaction on a particular event. Amazon can understand user feedback or review on the specific product. BookMyShow can discover people's opinion about the movie. Youtube can also analyze and understand peoples viewpoints on a video.\n\nIn this tutorial, you are going to cover the following topics:\n* Text Analytics and NLP\n* Compare Text Analytics, NLP and Text Mining\n    * Text Analysis Operations using NLTK\n    * Tokenization\n    * Stopwords\n    * Lexicon Normalization such as Stemming and Lemmatization\n    * POS Tagging\n* Sentiment Analysis\n* Text Classification\n* Performing Sentiment Analysis using Text Classification\n\n## Text Analytics and NLP\n\nText communication is one of the most popular forms of day to day conversion. We chat, message, tweet,  share status, email, write blogs, share opinion and feedback in our daily routine.  All of these activities are generating text in a significant amount, which is unstructured in nature. I this area of the online marketplace and social media, It is essential to analyze vast quantities of data, to understand peoples opinion.\n\nNLP enables the computer to interact with humans in a natural manner. It helps the computer to understand the human language and derive meaning from it. NLP is applicable in several problematic from speech recognition, language translation, classifying documents to information extraction. Analyzing movie review is one of the classic examples to demonstrate a simple NLP Bag-of-words model, on movie reviews.\n\n## Compare Text Analytics, NLP and Text Mining\n\nText mining also referred to as text analytics. Text mining is a process of exploring sizeable textual data and find patterns. Text Mining process the text itself, while NLP process with the underlying metadata. Finding frequency counts of words, length of the sentence, presence/absence of specific words is known as text mining. Natural language processing is one of the components of text mining. NLP helps identified sentiment,  finding entities in the sentence,  and category of blog/article. Text mining is preprocessed data for text analytics.  In Text Analytics,  statistical and machine learning algorithm used to classify information.","metadata":{},"id":"243427cc","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Text Analysis Operations using NLTK\n\nNLTK is a powerful Python package that provides a set of diverse natural languages algorithms.

What users and the general public think about the latest feature? You can quantify such information with reasonable accuracy using sentiment analysis.\n\nQuantifying users content, idea, belief, and opinion is known as sentiment analysis. User's online post, blogs, tweets, feedback of product helps business people to the target audience and innovate in products and services. Sentiment analysis helps in understanding people in a better and more accurate way. It is not only limited to marketing, but it can also be utilized in politics, research, and security.\n\nHuman communication just not limited to words, it is more than words. Sentiments are combination words, tone, and writing style. As a data analyst, It is more important to understand our sentiments, what it really means?\n\n![sentiment analysis](graphics/figure1.png)\n\nThere are mainly two approaches for performing sentiment analysis.\n* Lexicon-based: count number of positive and negative words in given text and the larger count will be the sentiment of text.\n\n* Machine learning based approach: Develop a classification model, which is trained using the pre-labeled dataset of positive, negative, and neutral.\n\nIn this Tutorial, you will use the second approach(Machine learning based approach). This is how you learn sentiment and text classification with a single example.\n\n## Text Classification\n\nText classification is one of the important tasks of text mining. It is a supervised approach. Identifying category or class of given text such as a blog, book, web page, news articles, and tweets. It has various application in today's computer world such as spam detection, task categorization in CRM services, categorizing products on E-retailer websites, classifying the content of websites for a search engine, sentiments of customer feedback, etc. In the next section, you will learn how you can do text classification in python.\n\n![text classification workflow](graphics/figure2.png)\n\n## Performing Sentiment Analysis using Text Classification\n","metadata":{},"id":"6d46a51d","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Import pandas\nimport pandas as pd","metadata":{},"id":"b8ea901a","cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"source":"#### Loading Data\n\nTill now, you have learned data pre-processing using NLTK.

BoW converts text into the matrix of occurrence of words within a document. This model concerns about whether given words occurred or not in the document.\n\nExample: There are three documents:\n\nDoc 1: I love dogs.\nDoc 2: I hate dogs and knitting.\nDoc 3: Knitting is my hobby and passion.\n\nNow, you can create a matrix of document and words by counting the occurrence of words in the given document. This matrix is known as Document-Term Matrix(DTM).\n\n![Document-Term Matrix(DTM)](graphics/figure3.png)\n\nThis matrix is using a single word.
